## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to create a responsive blog preview card using HTML and CSS. I focused on structuring the HTML semantically and applying styles to achieve a clean and modern design. I also practiced using CSS Grid for layout and hover effects for interactivity.

I learned how to use Figma to extract design attributes like colors, fonts, and dimensions. This helped me ensure that my implementation closely matched the design specifications.
